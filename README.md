# Western Engineering Competiton - Programming, 2023

The following project was created for the Programming Category at the 2023 Western Engineering Competition.

The purpose of this project is to provide more readable visualizations to complex CO2 emission data. 

For how the data was extracted, cleaned, and pre-processed check out the [Extraction](https://github.com/joshrabovsky/WEC-2023/tree/master/extraction) folder.

For the visualization of the data (including a pretty cool dynamic CO2 year planning tool), check out the [Visualization](https://github.com/joshrabovsky/WEC-2023/tree/master/visualization) folder.
